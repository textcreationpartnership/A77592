            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entlemen, Country-men, my noble friends and fellow Souldiers, I have a few words to deliver to you which may deſerve your attentions; and will I hope meet as good welcome &amp; acceptation from you, as they came from me, with the true zeal to your ſafeties and the wel-fares of the afflicted Countrey: we behold the flouriſhing and beauteous face of this Kingdome, over-ſpread with the leproſie of a Civill War: In which, ſince we are forced for the ſafeguard of our lives, the preſervation of our liberties, the defence of Gods true Religion <hi>(invaded by the practiſes of Papiſts and Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants)</hi> to become actors: I doubt not but each of you will play your part with that noble reſolution and Chriſtian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as the greatneſſe and meritoriouſneſſe of the work does challenge. No man is born for his own uſe only, ſaith that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:155735:3"/>great Common-wealths-man of the <hi>Romans, Cicero,</hi> his friends and Countrey-men claim an ample ſhare in his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as your friends, your Countrey, nay your Religion and God himſelf demands in yours. And ſurely it would be both unnaturall and impious to denie ſuch powerfull ſuitors your aſſiſtance. I need not remonſtrate what it is you are to fight for, the Cauſe is ſo open and obvious to every underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. It is for your wives, your children, and your ſubſtance, your lives and liberties, nay that which is more powerfull to move mens affections, the teſtimony of good conſciences, and what ever can be to humane frailty deare and precious; all theſe, as if they ſought the way to new miſchiefes through the old ones, are pointed at by the Popiſh malignants now in arms againſt us: they have plundered our neighbours, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed their eſtates out of their poſſeſſions, and committed inhumane and unheard of barbarouſneſſe in every place where the tempeſt of their fury has had licence to ſhew it's malice: And can you imagin they would ſtay there, that their inſatiate avarice &amp; thirſt of bloud wil be quenched and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with theſe petty ſpoiles: No Gentlemen, they aim at you, at all our ruines, deſolations, &amp; deaths, are machinated by theſe vipers, who would knaw a paſſage to their ambitions, throgh the intralls of their mother the Common-wealth; whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction they have purſued as craftily and violently, as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be expected from perſons of ſo much acrimony and ſpleen to the Subjects liberties, and averſion of true Religion and all goodneſſe: perſwaſions to valiant men, as I know you to be, are uſeleſſe, and if I thought there were any of you that was not incited more by the juſtice of the quarrell, then my Oratory to fight in this Cauſe, ſurely I ſhould rather wiſh his room then his company; for if the Nobility and brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Cauſe bee not ſufficient to animate cowards, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:155735:3"/>make the meaneſt ſpirits couragious. I know not what poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible can ſtir up mortal men to put on undaunted reſolutions: Behold your wives with teares in their eyes, and their little infants at their breaſts or in their hands, imploring ſafety and defence from your armes, and ſhould you deſert them and expoſe their innocence to the rapine and fury of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants. I doubt not but they would be ready to meet you as thoſe Roman Matrons of old did their flying perſons and husbands, and aske if they thought to creep againe into their mothers wombs and hide themſelves. Nay, which ſhould be more prevalent, to excite your courage to fight this good fight for the Lord of hoſts; your Religion and freedome of your Conſciences, which far tranſcends your corporeall liberty, invoaks you to ſtand up it's champions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Papiſticall Malignants; who would ſtrike at God through the very heart of his known truth, ſo long pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt us: And ſurely nothing can be dearer to any of Conſcience, then the ſecurity of this his Conſcience, and it's unvaluable freedome: you have viewd and heard my good friends and Countrey-men, with what ſeverity and ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe theſe adverſaries to all truth and humanity, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated the neighbour Townes and Countreyes, leaving them neither money nor victualls, and which is worſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of all means to ſupply thoſe neceſſities, or recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe wants, by carrying away their cattell and horſes, the inſtruments of their husbandry and tillage: expect you the ſame meaſure, Gentlemen, if you quit not your ſelves like men: and whereas the going againſt the King may ſtagger ſome reſolutions, I ſhall eaſily diſabuſe you from thoſe vaine ſurmiſes and incertain imaginations, 'tis for the King wee fight, to keep a Crown for our King, a Kingdom for our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign &amp; his poſterity, to maintain his known rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155735:4"/>which are relative with the peoples liberties, from a ſort of deſperate State incendiaries, that in ſeeming to fight for his Majeſty brandiſh open arms againſt his ſacred Crown and Dignity. For if you will but obſerve the men of whom the adverſe army is compounded, you ſhall find them eyther notorious Papiſts or Popiſhly affected perſons, and then be convinced in your own reaſons, if it be poſſible, that thoſe men ſhould take up arms in the Kings defence whom by ſo many divelliſh plots and helliſh ſtratagems, have ſought not onely his precious life, but the lives of his Predeceſſors Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> and his Father of ſacred memory, as that never to be forgotten powder plot ſhall for ever teſtifie to their ſhame &amp; confuſion of face: wherein they would at one blow not only have deſtroyed our pious King that now reignes <hi>(and long may he live and reign over us)</hi> but his Father, brother, and all the royall Progeny with the chiefe of the Nobility of the Kingdome. And if theſe men be competent perſons to be intruſted with the Kings ſafety, who have ſo apparantly ſought his ruine, let all indifferent men be judg, or that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Jeſuited perſons will ever fight to maintaine that Religion which they manifeſtly oppugne in their lives and doctrines, and have both by foraign and domeſtick treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſought to root out from the face of the earth, as by 88. and other of their attempts is manifeſt and perſpicuous, that they ſhould be patriots to keep our lawes and religion from violation or alteration, whoſe Juſtice points them out for diſturbers of the publique Peace, and renders them able to puniſhments in their eſtates and perſons, as notorious and convicted Malefactors; as well we may believe the light is a friend to darkneſſe, or that the warring Elements ſhould ceaſe their perpetuall difference, as allow that paradox.</p>
            <p>But I would not, Countrymen, be too tedious to you. And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155735:4"/>touching theſe Gentlemen, who being ſtrangers come hither to proffer us their ſervice, and in teſtimoniall of their abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and that they have been Commanders in the Germane Warrs, have here produced their ſeverall Certificates.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs thanke the Gentlemen for their kind proffer, and yet deſire licence to be plaine with them, hoping they will not take it as a diſparagement to their vallours, if I tell them we have now too woefull experience in this Kingdom of the German warres; and therefore cannot ſo well approve of the ayde of forraigne and mercinary auxiliaries. In Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many they fought onely for ſpoile, rapine and deſtruction, meerely money it was and hope of gaine that excited the Souldier to that ſervice: It is not here ſo required as the cauſe ſtands with us; Wee muſt rather imploy men who will fight meerely for the Cauſe ſake, and beare their owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, than thoſe who expect rewards and ſalaries, for by ſuch meanes we ſhall never have a concluſion of theſe warres; for mercenaries, whoſe end is meerely their pay, whereas their ſubſiſtance rather covet to ſpin out the warres to a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous length, as they have done in other Countries, then to ſee them quickly brought to a happy period; wee muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch this great work in a ſhort time or be all liable to inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ruine. I ſhall therefore freely ſpeake my conſcience, I had rather have a thouſand or two thouſand honeſt Citizens that can onely handle their armes, whoſe hearts goe with their hands, than two thouſand of mercinary Souldiers, that boaſt of their forraigne experience. For ſuch make money meerely the end of their endeavours, without looking into the Juſtice of the Cauſe, when thoſe well-affected Citizens being acquainted with the cauſe which is for Almighty God, their Religion, the Lawes of the Land, the Subjects Liberty and ſafety wil now be a means to be incouraged &amp; be anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155735:5"/>to goe on couragiouſly in this great work, (knowing that good deeds are rewarded in themſelves) if God bee not pleaſed to give a blesſing to the work in hand by a faire and honeſt Accommodation betweene his Majeſty and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to give a ceſſation to theſe warres. And yet I heare of many who will neither lend their money nor give their ayde and aſſiſtance in this ſo weighty a matter, <hi>(as I have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;)</hi> yet looke to bee defended and kept from violence as well as thoſe men which ſo freely and voluntarily contribute to the great charges, why ſhould ſuch men ſtand, and onely looking on like ciphers, yet hoping to have ſhare and benefit in the common good; when other men both take the pains, hazard their lives, and ſpend their eſtates for them and theirs, what man would not give the twentieth part of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to ſave the other nineteen from being taken from him, nay, and it may bee his life too. And ſo I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinde my Speech, and turne into prayer this my Diſcourſe; That God Almighty will ariſe and maintaine his own cauſe, ſcattering and confounding the devices of his enemies, not ſuffering the ungodly to prevaile over his poore innocent flocke. Lord, we are but a handfull in conſideration of thine and our enemies, therefore O Lord fight thou our battailes, goe out as thou didſt in the time of King <hi>David</hi> before the Hoſts of thy ſervants, and ſtrengthen and give us hearts, that we ſhew our ſelves men for the defence of thy true Religion, and our owne and the King and Kingdomes ſafety.</p>
